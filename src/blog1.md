In TypeScript, union and intersection types play a crucial role in creating flexible, powerful types that allow you to represent a wider variety of data structures and enforce more specific constraints. Let’s explore the significance of each:

Union Types (|):
A union type allows a variable to hold a value that could be one of several types. Union types are denoted by the | (pipe) symbol. They are helpful when a value could logically belong to multiple types, and you want to limit the type options to a few specific ones.

Significance:
.Flexibility: Union types provide flexibility by allowing values of multiple types, helping model scenarios where a variable can accept different data types.
2.Input Validation: Union types help with validation and control over input, ensuring that values are only those specified in the union.
3.Error Prevention: With union types, TypeScript can enforce type checking on allowed values, helping prevent errors caused by using unintended types.
4.Conditional Logic: Union types enable type narrowing, where TypeScript automatically infers the correct type within code blocks based on conditions.

Practical Use Cases of Union Types:
Creating a variable that accepts multiple formats (e.g., a date parameter that could be a string or Date object).
Defining function parameters where inputs may come in various types but need to be constrained.

example:
/*
    function processInput(input: string | number) {
  if (typeof input === "string") {
    console.log(input.toUpperCase()); // TypeScript knows `input` is a string here
  } else {
    console.log(input.toFixed(2)); // TypeScript knows `input` is a number here
  }
}

*/


Intersection Types (&):
An intersection type represents a combination of multiple types. It allows you to define a type that has all the properties of two or more types, often used for combining object types.

Significance:
1.Type Composition: Intersection types are powerful for creating complex types by combining simpler types, allowing for a modular approach to type design.
2.Strong Type Enforcement: By combining types, intersection types enforce that a variable must meet the requirements of all intersected types, which is useful in cases where multiple characteristics are required.
3.Reusability: Intersection types allow you to reuse existing types in a new structure, keeping your type definitions DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

Example:

/*

type Name = { name: string };
type Age = { age: number };
type Person = Name & Age; // Intersection of `Name` and `Age`

const user: Person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 }; // Must have both `name` and `age`

*/

Practical Use Cases of Intersection Types:
Combining multiple interfaces to create an object that needs properties from each.
Extending type definitions where different types are merged to meet complex structural requirements, such as in React props or API responses.
